# Live Video Messenger Design Challenge

## Context

In 2024, a recruiter reached out from a company that operates a live-streaming
video site, similar to Twitch. I applied for their Principal Engineer role, and
was asked to complete the following design challenge.

To protect the integrity of their hiring processes, the company has asked not to
be identified.

I was asked to complete a virtual interview loop consisting of four one-hour
interviews, each with two members of the team. I was offered and subsequently
declined the position.
